    <p1> For our first project we designed a hangman game which included a list of fruits as the words to be guessed. The game ran typically the same as actual hangman although at the end there was a winning and losing animation. We used a while loop that would until there you had zero guesses left. We had if statements nested within the while loop that determined what would happen if a letter was guessed correcty or incorrectly.
